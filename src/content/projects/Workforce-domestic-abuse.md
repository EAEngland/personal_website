We examined the connection between the emotional well-being of workers in the UK domestic abuse sector and their workplace environments. We focused on the challenges faced by these workers, such as financial and housing instability, job stress, burnout, and the paradoxical sense of empowerment and identification with their roles. The study utilized a cross-sectional design.
