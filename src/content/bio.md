I am a Senior Lecturer in Social Policy and Practice in the School of Education
and Social Policy at Cardiff Metropolitan University, with a PhD from the
School of Geography and Planning at Cardiff University. I am interested in
experiences of giving and receiving different kinds of care, by different
structures, institutions and individuals. I write about homelessness, domestic
abuse and neurodiversity (including autism and dementia). I explore how gender,
sexuality and space can help us understand these better. My background is in
welfare rights and homelessness policy and research. I have worked with a range
of organisations including Shelter Cymru, Platfform, Centre for Homelessness
Impact, End Youth Homelessness Cymru and Crisis. I have also won several awards
for my work, including the Housing Studies Association Valerie Karn Prize 2021,
    a Women in Wales Audrey Jones Award 2021 and a Wales Online Diversity Award
    2022.
