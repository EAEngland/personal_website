Following the introduction of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014, I looked at the shift toward universal conditionality in the context of homelessness relief in Wales. I drew on interviews with 98 actors in the Welsh homelessness system, supplemented by ethnography and documentary analysis. I used a Foucauldian lens, complicated by care ethics (Tronto, 2013; 2017). I showed that while the Act incorporated elements of a workfare approach, conditionality was, in practice, reluctantly and imperfectly enacted. I found that although the Act relied upon the discourses of moralism and pragmatism, it was complicated by an understanding of care as an urgent obligation. Spatialised bureaucracies created contested spaces of power, and the Act needs to be understood within a wider context of shifting citizen-state obligations. The research also highlighted the importance of discourse-based approaches to understanding policy as dynamic, dialectical, entities. This was my doctoral work, conducted between 2017-2020.
