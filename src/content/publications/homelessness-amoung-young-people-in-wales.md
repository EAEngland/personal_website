This report draws on the interim findings of the Homelessness among trans
people in Wales study by Shelter Cymru/ Welsh Government, in collaboration with
Cardiff University. It draws upon interviews with 25 trans people who had
experienced homelessness in Wales, showing that trans people face unique
challenges that both contribute to their homelessness and make it harder for
them to resolve it. Familial rejection, relationship breakdown, abuse and
economic instability were all important routes into homelessness for trans
people, and there was evidence of repeated system failures to intervene to
protect them. While some services were helpful – especially those targeted at
LGBTQ+ people – there was a clear need for better training for staff, as well
as support for staff to enable them to have time and resources to help trans
people. We also found that trans people are often very wary of accessing
services, and even when they do, frequently disengage due to exclusion and
discrimination, and that this contributes to unresolved homelessness.
