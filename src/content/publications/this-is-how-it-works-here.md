Based on interviews with 28 trans people with homeless experience, I examine
the experiences of trans individuals in homeless service spaces. I show that
hostels, nightshelters, drop in centres and day centres – ‘spaces of care’ –
are instrumental in reinforcing a binary view of gender, through a privileging
of hegemonic masculinity. Trans people reported being subject to intense
surveillance, being responsibilised for violence directed at them, and were
often the ones to be relocated where they experienced violence, with
implications for their ability to develop sustainable support networks. There
was some sympathy for staff, who were seen as underpaid and undertrained;
however failure to intervene in instances of transphobic and homophobic abuse
normalised spatial exclusion, marginalised the emotional well-being of trans
individuals and lead to disengagement from services by trans individuals. The
research highlights the importance of spatial dynamics in creating homelessness
services which are functionally accessible to trans and queer people.
