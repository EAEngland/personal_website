In this paper, we argue that the introduction of a justiciable right to
homelessness prevention and relief in Wales has created a complex welfare
bureaucracy. Using a mixed methods approach, we explore whether these housing
rights have a paradoxical effect, focusing on the tension between positive
impacts for applicants against distancing and exclusion. We argue that while,
on the one hand, there is evidence of a faceless bureaucracy characterised by
silencing and subordination, and supported by exclusionary paperwork, there is
also evidence that frontline staff do try to operate inclusively, extending the
law where they can. We highlight the complexities of a rights-based
homelessness system, and especially the challenges of implementing statutory
rights to assistance in practice.
