LGBTQ+ homelessness research has gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.
While certain groups, like young people in LGBTQ+ concentrated areas, have been
extensively studied, others such as trans individuals, those over 25, rural
LGBTQ+ people, and those not accessing services remain largely unknown.
Assumptions about LGBTQ+ homelessness abound, like the assumption that young
people are more at risk or that LGBTQ+ competent services can follow existing
homelessness models. Important questions that require answers include the
percentage of the LGBTQ+ population experiencing homelessness, differences in
experiences within the LGBTQ+ population, regional disparities in LGBTQ+
homelessness, and the specific needs and desires of LGBTQ+ individuals facing
or at risk of homelessness. By participating in the UK population-wide LGBTQ+
Housing and Homelessness Survey, individuals can contribute to crucial data
collection for researchers. Additionally, researchers in the field are
encouraged to connect with each other to foster a network addressing LGBTQ+
homelessness.
