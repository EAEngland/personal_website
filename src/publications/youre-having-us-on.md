Domestic abuse is a leading cause of female homelessness and addressing it has
been a key strategic aim internationally. I argue that moral commitments and
integration of human rights frameworks cannot compensate for enforceable legal
rights in meaningfully addressing domestic abuse. Using the Welsh homelessness
system as a casestudy, I draw on interviews with homelessness workers and
applicants to the statutory Welsh homelessness system to explore frontline
interactions for those who have experienced domestic abuse. I show that
homelessness service provision is set up to regard addressing domestic abuse as
outside their remit, to see female empowerment as evidencing lack of need, and
to see cases involving domestic abuse as a threat to the scarce resources
within homelessness services. I highlight a need for stronger integration
between policy ideals and frontline practices as part of an integrated approach
to addressing domestic abuse.
