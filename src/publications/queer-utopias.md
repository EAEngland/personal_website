In this article, we argue that law, policy and practice surrounding the
homelessness system in England, Scotland and Wales should be more inclusive of
the needs of LGBTQ+ people. We look at how the legal system is based upon the
norm of the heterosexual, cisgendered, nuclear family, and how this operates to
discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. We look at how support services can
perpetrate discrimination, despite apparently good intentions, and the
importance of embedding LGBTQ+ inclusion in homelessness services. We embed
this within Levitas’ utopian approach (Levitas, 1990), arguing that we need to
‘queer’ homelessness law and policy to create better outcomes for LGBTQ+
homeless individuals.
