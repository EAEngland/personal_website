Trans people are at greater risk of risk of homelessness, largely as a result of legal, bureaucratic, and socio-economic marginalisation. Attempts have been made within welfare structures to improve service provision to better meet the needs of trans people, reflecting recent expansions in rights and protections for trans individuals. However, it is clear that discriminatory practices persist and that these are likely to originate at a system level. Drawing on interviews with 35 homeless trans people and 12 system workers, I show that anti-discrimination legislation alone is not sufficient to protect trans people from institutional exclusion. Rather we need to consider how assumptions made within service organisation, including design and commissioning, centre the needs of cis and heteronormative individuals and pathologise trans identities. I suggest that to provide truly inclusive services which address the high rates of homelessness in the trans population we need to include trans people in design of solutions.
