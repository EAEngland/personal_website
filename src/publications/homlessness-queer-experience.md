I explore the significant challenges faced by trans people experiencing homelessness and the inadequate support services available to them. Drawing upon interviews with 35 trans individuals with experience of homelessness, I investigate how community support rooted in queer praxis and concrete utopian thinking is essential to queer survival. I highlight the crucial, largely invisibilised, role of queer practices of mutual aid and utopian possibility in engendering community support for homeless trans individuals. I show that trans and queer communities provide extensive practical, material, and emotional support that counteracts the exclusion they face within statutory services, but also argue that this is putting communities under pressure. The study emphasises the criticality of community support in the survival of homeless trans individuals within an unwelcoming system and offers strategies to address inequitable service failures while promoting housing justice.
