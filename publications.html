experienced homelessness in Wales, showing that trans people face unique
challenges that both contribute to their homelessness and make it harder for
them to resolve it. Familial rejection, relationship breakdown, abuse and
economic instability were all important routes into homelessness for trans
people, and there was evidence of repeated system failures to intervene to
protect them. While some services were helpful – especially those targeted at
LGBTQ+ people – there was a clear need for better training for staff, as well
as support for staff to enable them to have time and resources to help trans
people. We also found that trans people are often very wary of accessing
services, and even when they do, frequently disengage due to exclusion and
discrimination, and that this contributes to unresolved homelessness.</p></noscript></div></li><li><div class="Research_paper__q1VLE"><div class="Research_ref__dkesR"><p>England, E<!-- -->. <!-- -->2022<!-- -->. <a>&#x27;<!-- -->Homelessness is a queer experience.: utopianism and mutual aid as survival strategies for homeless trans people Homelessness is a queer experience<!-- -->&#x27;</a>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Housing Studies<!-- --> <!-- -->(<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2022.2108381">10.1080/02673037.2022.2108381</a>)<!-- --> <!-- -->pp. <!-- -->1<!-- -->-<!-- -->18<button class="MoreBtn_moreBtn__Gyw21"><i>«<!-- -->more<!-- -->»</i></button></p></div><noscript><p>I explore the significant challenges faced by trans people experiencing homelessness and the inadequate support services available to them.

hostels, nightshelters, drop in centres and day centres – ‘spaces of care’ –

of hegemonic masculinity. Trans people reported being subject to intense
surveillance, being responsibilised for violence directed at them, and were
often the ones to be relocated where they experienced violence, with
implications for their ability to develop sustainable support networks. There
was some sympathy for staff, who were seen as underpaid and undertrained;
however failure to intervene in instances of transphobic and homophobic abuse
normalised spatial exclusion, marginalised the emotional well-being of trans
