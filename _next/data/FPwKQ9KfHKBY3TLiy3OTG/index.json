{"pageProps":{"content":"I am a Senior Lecturer in Social Policy and Practice in the School of Education and Social Policy at Cardiff Metropolitan University. My PhD is from the School of Geography and Planning at Cardiff University (funders: [UK Centre for Collaborative Housing Evidence](https://housingevidence.ac.uk/)). My doctoral work looked at the implementation of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 from the perspective of those delivering the new system and those applying under it.\n\nI write about bureaucracy, sexuality and neurodiversity (including autism and dementia). I am especially interested in how space is experienced differently by different groups, and in exploring how we can use care ethics to think about reducing inequalities. My current projects include a large wellbeing study of the domestic abuse sector workforce (funded by Cardiff Met's Global Academies scheme) and a mixed methods study of LGBTQ+ homelessness.\n\nAwards/honours include: the Housing Studies Association Valerie Karn Prize 2021, a [Women in Wales Audrey Jones Award 2021 awardee](https://walesassemblyofwomen.co.uk/awards.html), and a Wales Online Diversity Award 2022. I was a [2020 European Sociological Association PhD Summer School attendee](https://www.europeansociology.org/european-sociologist/issue/46/from-esa/8a87a578-895c-4bc6-8aac-3f16f62b19fa) and am a [2023 Welsh Crucible attendee].(https://welshcrucible.org.uk/)\n\n\nPrior to academia, I worked in welfare rights/homelessness policy and research. I have produced research for organizations including Shelter Cymru, Platfform, Centre for Homelessness Impact, End Youth Homelessness Cymru, and Crisis.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
