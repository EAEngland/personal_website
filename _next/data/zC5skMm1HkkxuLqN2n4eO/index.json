{"pageProps":{"content":"LGBTQ+ homelessness research has gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.\nWhile certain groups, like young people in LGBTQ+ concentrated areas, have been\nextensively studied, others such as trans individuals, those over 25, rural\nLGBTQ+ people, and those not accessing services remain largely unknown.\nAssumptions about LGBTQ+ homelessness abound, like the assumption that young\npeople are more at risk or that LGBTQ+ competent services can follow existing\nhomelessness models. Important questions that require answers include the\npercentage of the LGBTQ+ population experiencing homelessness, differences in\nexperiences within the LGBTQ+ population, regional disparities in LGBTQ+\nhomelessness, and the specific needs and desires of LGBTQ+ individuals facing\nor at risk of homelessness. By participating in the UK population-wide LGBTQ+\nHousing and Homelessness Survey, individuals can contribute to crucial data\ncollection for researchers. Additionally, researchers in the field are\nencouraged to connect with each other to foster a network addressing LGBTQ+\nhomelessness."},"__N_SSG":true}
