Some groups have been extensively studied – especially\nyoung people in urban areas. Others have had very little attention – those over\n25, those in rural areas and those not accessing homelessness support services.\nThis survey is the largest of its kind. It will provide baseline information\nabout the percentage of LGBTQ+ people experiencing homelessness, how many\nLGBTQ+ people have experienced homelessness and risk of homelessness over their\nlives, and how many LGBTQ+ people are at risk of homelessness. It will also\nimprove our understanding of how LGBTQ+ homelessness is geographically\ndistributed (where LGBTQ+ people at risk of homelessness live), and how age and\nidentity might affect risk of homelessness. The survey is running until autumn\n2023 and open to all UK resident LGBTQ+ adults You can complete it [here](https://cardiffmet.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ilAS1eyIZwEAHc)\n\n## Phase 2: Queer narratives of home/lessness\n\nStarting in early 2024, we will be looking at how loss of home interacts with\ngeographic mobility. Queer migration, especially rural to urban, has a dual\nresonance. Among policy-makers it has largely been understood in terms of loss\nand desperation, while among queer people it has cultural resonance as a theme\nof [hope, beginning and becoming](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88sARuFu-tc>).\nIt is complicated by homelessness policies which do not recognise aspects of\nqueer experience, such as the importance of found families. We will use\nnarrative mapping to explore the importance of space, place, time and identity\nto queer people who have experienced homelessness.\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Homelessness among trans people in Wales"},"content":"Trans people are at [greater risk of homelessness](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf), but very little work exists exploring their distinct experiences.
